## How to run the project

Make sure to install the npm packages in both the `frontend` and `backend` folders.

Run `npm install` in both folders.

Then create the react production optimized build by running `npm run-script build`.

Then run the project by typing `npm start` in the terminal.

Note: A `.env` file is needed in the `backend` folder to contain the URI for the Atlas Database among other things that we don't want exposed to the public
